                <p class="study">I chose ICT because I spend a lot of time in front of my laptop and also I find the coding interesting. 
                  In the future almost everything will be controlled by the computers and also I have always dreamed of creating a video game. 
                  I believe that during the study I will learn a lot about working in teams and this will help me in the future.</p>
                  <p class="study">After I graduate, I would like to start a career as a software engineer and maybe start a company. In addition, I will try to make my dream come true.</p>

                <p class=swot><b>Strengths</b> - I am responsible and reliable person. I get along with everyone.</p>
                <p class=swot><b>Weaknesses</b> - I overthink a lot and I also struggle to stay motivated.</p>
                <p class=swot><b>Opportunities</b> - First you should identify the weakness and then accept it. 
                  You can't turn a weakness into a opportunity if you're denying it.</p>
                <p class=swot><b>Threats</b> - The new environment can be a threat until you get used to it. I don't think that a weakness can prevent me from succeeding,
                   if I want to succeed I will do everything for it</p>

                   one of which was object-oriented programming. Also, during my last year at school I took Java basics programming course.</p>

                  Glad to hear about your interest in computers and coding. What is it that interests you so much in these subjects? 
                  Some more detail would be good. 
                  Good to see you have already thought about your future after this study. 
                  During the study you will learn about many job posibilites you probably aren't familiar with yet.
                   You will indeed learn a lot about teamwork since many of our courses will involve working in a team.  
                  Start thinking about ways to avoid overthinking. Perhaps you could share it with your team so they can help you avoid it.</p>
                  <p class="feedback">Kind regards,</p>
