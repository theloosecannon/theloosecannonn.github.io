        <h2 class = "whyInformation">Why should you choose ICT?</h2>
        <p class="first">Information and communication technologies have exploded in popularity around the world. People can now communicate internationally with instant messaging, voice over IP (VoIP), and video-conferencing. Social networking sites also facilitate the ease of communication across countries.
          A typical ICT degree focuses on business uses for computer networks. While you wont study the theoretical aspects of modern computing, you will learn the theory of networks, the architecture of operating systems, and hardware operations.
          You should also learn practical skills, like computer repair, fixing routers and switches, and network server operating systems and their configurations.
          Some of your work will overlap with the IT world, and some of it will focus specifically on the communications piece.</p>

        We live in a connected world in which physical objects are massively linked to the internet. 
        Think of a security camera that sends a message to your smartphone when a person walks through your garden. 
        Or AI (artificial intelligence), where a self-learning algorithm learns whether it is safe to cross a street. 
        IT is the field that makes these developments possible and creates them.</p>
